# JS-Clock
This is not just a typical clock that you'd find on your wall or on your wrist, this is a piece of art which I've created using my knowledge on JavaScript and CSS. I wanted to up my game in working with JavaScript while still getting down CSS under my belt, so I found some resources out there to help with this project and to bring imagination to life.
